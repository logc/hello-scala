## Generated with Scaladoc

This documentation is generated purely with features from the [built-in
Scaladoc](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/scaladoc/index.html),
without any external dependencies. The Scala version has to be 3, though. It
does not work with the Scaladoc shuipped with 2.

The contents of README are added to the static documentation's index page [by
setting a
configuration](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/scaladoc/settings.html#-doc-root-content).

## Code blocks

Just an example. The configuration `"-snippet-compiler:compile"` on `build.sbt`
makes the build fail if the examples cannot be compiled.

```scala
val x = 1
List(x, x)
```

```scala
import com.example.hello.Example
```
