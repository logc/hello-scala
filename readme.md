# hello-scala

This is a proof of concept repository about the generation of documentation in
a Scala 3 project.

There is no functional code in the implementation, but the `build.sbt` and
`src/docs` portions of the project are what generate the `docs` folder, which
is intended to be served statically by a web server.

You can read more on the [docs](docs) section or continue here for API
documentation.

Tested with Scala 3.3.1, sbt 1.9.6 and Java 19.0.2
